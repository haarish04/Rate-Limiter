# Build Your Own Rate Limiter

This application is my solution to the first part of the Coding Challenges series. The page to the challenge can be found [here](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-rate-limiter/).

## Description

This challenge is to build an API rate limiter.

Rate limiters are a key part of building an API or large scale distributed system, they help when we wish to throttle traffic based on the user. They allow you to ensure that one or more bad actors canâ€™t accidentally or deliberately overload the service.

To help with visualizing rate limiting have a look at this [blog](https://smudge.ai/blog/ratelimit-algorithms)
